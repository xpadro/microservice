# Spring Cloud Config Server executing on local machine
#spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888
spring.cloud.config.uri=http://123.123.123.123:8888

# Explanation:
# If this app has to access another IP on the host machine when executed inside a Docker container,
# we have to attach an IP alias to your host network interface instead of 'localhost' by executing the
# following command:

# > sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 123.123.123.123/24
